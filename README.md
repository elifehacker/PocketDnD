# PocketDnD

This is the result of self-taught Android application development methodology. It should also demostrate my OOP skills.
It was inspired by the game 旅かえる and Fallout Shelter on android. This project has integrated DnD elements. The player could equip weapons and gears for the hero who would go on adventures on its own. Locations are randomized from a pool of 8 maps, each has a discinctive description and enemy layout. There are events such as conversation, exploration, persuation, stealth and accident. Each will do a check on character's status to pass. It has an automated battle system build around the level and status of the character and enemy. Once the hero finishes a journey, it will unpack all the item and equipment he aquired to home for the player to equip. At home, the hero will decide to do trainings on certains status and eventual it will decide to go on another adventure on its own. The difficulty of adventures and encouters are scaled based on the hero's stats. Overall, it should give quite a laid back experience for the player seeing the hero grow.
