It trails you, hushed as the night, dancing between the trees as the sunlight flickers. It melts into darkness with the arrival of dusk, until it blends and disappears against the backdrop of nothingness. But it remains, only neglected. Like the stars during the day – overpowered by the pouring rays of sunlight – but yet still there. As night whisks away it joins you once more, hailing like an old friend. It mirrors your actions, as though looking up to you, surveying and admiring my every move. An immaculate outline of your shape, an echo of your movements, a lifetime companion, it shadows you; a shadow of a hero.
