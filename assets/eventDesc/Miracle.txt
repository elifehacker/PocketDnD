You were blocked by a stone gate engraved with ancient glyphs. It was infused with magic. 
You recite a phrase from an elder scroll. “Edr- i bloodui fen. Ceri- u- ech- win ped- ha ad-!” The glyphs radiated blue lights in response… it opened!
You tried every spell you knew. The gate remains unhinged regardless.
