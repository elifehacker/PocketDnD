Restless viridian eyes sit buried within the creature's rounded, scaled skull, which gives the creature a savage looking appearance.
Several horns sit atop its head, just above its long, round ears. Several rows of crystal growths runs down the sides of each of its jaw lines.
Its nose is short and has two wide, warped nostrils and there's a tendril on its chin. Several rows of large teeth poke out from the side of its mouth and reveal only a fraction of the terror hiding inside.

A thick neck runs down from its head and into a long body. The top is covered in crystal-like skin and a row of armor plating runs down its spine.
Its bottom is covered in radiant skin and is colored slightly lighter than the rest of its body. Two mighty limbs carry its body and allow the creature to stand intimidating and proud. Each limb has 4 digits, each of which end in long talons seemingly made of obsidian.

Huge wings grow starting from just below its shoulders and end at its hips. The wings are somewhat triangular, the skin of the wings seems to glow as if made from fire itself and long tendril-like growths grow from many parts of the bottom sides of each wing.

Its thick tail ends in a fan-like tip and is covered in the same crystal-like skin as its body.
