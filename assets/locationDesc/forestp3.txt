A mishmash of animal sounds, which were caused by insects, resonated through the air, and formed a chaotic orchestra with the raging river currents clashing against boulders.
A disharmony of beastly sounds, which were caused by vermin, echoed in the air, and drowned out the sounds of a fight over dominance between larger animals.
A clamor of wild noises, which were caused by critters, echoed in the air, and drowned out the rustling of the leaves and branches of the tree tops in the wind.
A tumult of noises, most of which were critters, added life to the forest, and were in harmony with the raging river currents clashing against boulders.
