The river passes through the jungle wide and opaque. The water is green, darker in the shadows and more pale in the light, but still green. Against the noise of the birds that are welcoming the new day the gentle murmur of the water can only just be heard, a backdrop to the musical notes coming from above. 
Sandy bank, nesting holes for martins (birds), grassy sloping bank, water flowing smoothly, gravel shallows, shallow shelf, wide still pool at edge, narrow foreshore at foot of steep bank, patch of reeds, cold water.
Boulders rise out of the water like the bows of a sunken fleet, and the hiss of far off waterfalls are the screams of their drowned crew. The scent of moss and lichen be-fowls the air for leagues across. The stream is the reminder to all that witness its majesty the ignorance of presumption, and the existence of exemption.
Its head is far inland in a place of mountain solitudes, but its mouth is all but on the lip of the sea...
The river is a slice of mellow harmony amid the fragrant leaves. It flows like time, always onward, always toward its destiny. One day these placid waters will enter that great ocean, each drop a vital part of what becomes the mighty aquatic world.
