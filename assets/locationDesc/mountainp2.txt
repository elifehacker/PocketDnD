The hills are a patchwork of green made even more varied by the shadows of passing clouds. They are every hue from new spring grass to deep forest pools. Some are more shallow that others, but most have steep paths that take you to one side of their summit and then down to the next valley below. 
The hills are little more than a layer of poor soil over rock. They are clothed in scrubby grass too poor to even put flesh on a goat. On the tops the wintry wind is fierce and bitter, in the valleys it is more still and the sunshine has real warmth. The pale brown path that was rutted by horses in the soggy fall is now frozen and hard enough to twist an ankle. 
The hills that lie friendly in the day - like the pillows of the land - are darkly ominous by night. The paths that were illuminated just hours before become lost in a blackness that even moonlight cannot help. The trees that are magnificent in sunshine tower over James as he steps across the borderline between the seen and unseen. 
The hills rolled like waves of an angry ocean before them and under the blanket of trees lay rocky escarpments and steep gorges. Their foothills overlapped making the valley river wend around them and the sky was dark and low giving a claustrophobic feel.
The hill was a broad knoll with a flat rocky top, to one side the escarpment fell away sharply, to the other it rolled away, gently undulant with tussocks. The grass grew thick and coarse, but was kept short by the sheep that grazed there.
