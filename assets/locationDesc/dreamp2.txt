Off to the side you hear growls and grunts of creatures not too different from the ones you know. While they seem curious and amicable, for now you simply keep your distance. You see traces of lean creatures, huge creatures, and what you think might be small creatures of some sort.
Fairly nearby you smell the pungent odors of creatures you've never seen before. Some have noticed you, and their interest has peaked, you keep your guard up just to be safe. You can make out lean creatures, hairy creatures, and what you think might be fluffy creatures of some sort.
In the far-off distance you hear songs and growls of creatures stranger even than those of legends of old. While they show you little interest, you realise it's probably best to keep your distance. You can see small creatures, gliding creatures, and what you think might be hairy creatures of some sort.
In the distance you feel the presence of beings you could've only dreamed of. Even though they don't seem to be bothered by your presence, you keep an eye out for them just to be sure. You manage to find traces of lean creatures, crawling creatures, and what you think might be aquatic creatures of some sort.
