The serrated mountains loomed in the distance. There were flour-white and brooded over the land.  A chute of snow detached itself and went trundling down one of the mountains. It slid over the knotted edge and then went crashing into the chasm below. The silence that followed was spine chilling. 
The heaven-touching apex of the mountain was drenched in brilliant light. Spikes of thin light impaled the snow in a bristling, moving line. The heat had displaced the snow from the hip of the time chiselled mountain. The tips of the mountain range stuck up like a row of thorns. Swaddled around them were necklaces of powdery snow. 
The mountains were covered with a rug of trees, green, yellow, scarlet and orange, but their bare tops were scarfed and beribboned with snow. From carved rocky outcrops, waterfalls drifted like skeins of white lawn, and in the fields we could see the amber glint of rivers and the occasional mirror-like flash of a mountain lake...
The tree stood ghost-like, the silent observer of the snowy mountains, the river and the clouds. The only thing bigger than range of granite peaks was the midnight sky, dotted with silver and as vast as any eye could wander. Below stood a girl, made all the more tiny, her red dress flimsy in the wind.
The mountains lay in a great line like the spine of the land. It was as if long ago they were a great beast, only to lie down one day and never get up. Perhaps the beast fell into an enchanted sleep, perhaps its soul was still in there. 
The mountains is like a heard of great grey scale that had lain down in the noon sun on some sunny prehistoric afternoon for a nap and never woken up. The mountain range were giant beasts, giant beasts that might one day stir and walk the earth with ground shaking strides.
